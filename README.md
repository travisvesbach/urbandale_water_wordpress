# Urbandale Water Wordpress

This is my first attempt at using Wordpress.  It is also my first attempt at making a custom theme for Wordpress.

## Uploaded

Uploaded here is my custom wordpress bootstrap theme folder.  It includes all the bootstrap files, my CSS, the header, footer, index, etc. php files to make it run.

The actual content for the individual pages was entered within the Wordpress dashboard.

## Build 

The goal of this project was to learn some basics about Wordpress and to build a theme that uses Bootstrap for its layout and responsive design.  

Urbandale Water was made based off of a few screenshots and photoshop files of the actual site made by <a href="https://www.webspecdesign.com/">Webspec Design</a>.


## Deployment

My Urbandale Water site has been deployed to Heroku.

MySQL was used during development, but because deployment was to Heroku, I used PostgreSQL for production.  In order to deploy to Heroku, I used mhoofman's wordpress-heroku repository found <a href="https://github.com/mhoofman/wordpress-heroku">here</a>.

Once Wordpress was deployed to Heroku, I exported my development site through my local Wordpress dashboard and then imported it with the Wordpress dashboard deployed to heroku.  After that, I just had to change a few settings in order to get things up and running properly.

## Viewing the site
